<p>Some of you might know that for the last few years I&#39;ve been going on a long
road to financial freedom through starting businesses. I am not free yet, but
I&#39;ve tracked one habit that helped me more than anything else.</p>

<p>Some people go to the woods, but it is much simpler - just learn to unplug.
If you are not sure on your path in life - unplug. If you got too much to do
- unplug. Got into a fight? Unplug.</p>

<p>Unplugging is giving yourself some head space. Turning off Facebook, phone, not
reading the news.</p>

<p>All that new information is worthless for your overfilled head anyways. You
start to care about things you should not care. You react to peoples opinions,
try to make sure everybody agrees with you. Stop that.</p>

<p>Go for a walk alone in a random neighbourhood. Hop on a random bus for a few
stops and explore. Giving myself space changed my perspective so many times.
Allow yourself to grow - don&#39;t let the fear fill your head with junk.</p>
